# telegram-assistant-agent
This is a telegram bot designed to help users with various tasks in direct messages and group chats.

It should be able to do common assistant tasks that devices like alexa can perform, such as adding to a calendar, creating a timer, or searching the web.

# Plan

The idea is for this to be an ongoing project that is consistently getting new features. The first thing to do is set up the basic bot.
We will:
1. Create a new telegram bot
2. Write a python script to interact with the chatbot
3. Integrate langchain for agents and tool use
4. Set up reliable hosting
5. Debug problems in basic system
6. Add features

For the first version we will just add a few features, and after that the project should mostly just be adding new features.
We will implement timers, web searching, calendars, and checklists in the first version. Features beyond these should be discussed in the ideas discussion.
